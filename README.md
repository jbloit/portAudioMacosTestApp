# Portaudio test app

Jump start code to use the [Portaudio lib](http://www.portaudio.com/) in a swift project, for handling the audio i/o.

## dependency
The Portaudio lib. See installation tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIswwa4UlRE).

Note: I had to add to run the following for it to compile:

```bash
./configure --disable-mac-universal && make
```
